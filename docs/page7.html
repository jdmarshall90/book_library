              From New York Times bestselling author James Rollins comes a novel of boundless imagination and meticulous research, a book that dares to answer a frightening question at the heart of America: Could the founding of the United States be based on a fundamental lie? The shocking truth lies hidden within the ruins of an impossibility, a lost colony of the Americas vanished in time and cursed into oblivion. A place known only as The Devil Colony.<br /><br />Deep in the Rocky Mountains, a gruesome discovery--hundreds of mummified bodies--stirs international attention and fervent controversy. Despite doubts about the bodies&#39; origins, the local Native American Heritage Commission lays claim to the prehistoric remains, along with the strange artifacts found in the same cavern: gold plates inscribed with an unfathomable script.<br /><br />During a riot at the dig site, an anthropologist dies horribly, burned to ashes in a fiery explosion in plain view of television cameras. All evidence points to a radical group of Native Americans, including one agitator, a teenage firebrand who escapes with a vital clue to the murder and calls on the one person who might help--her uncle, Painter Crowe, Director of Sigma Force.<br /><br />To protect his niece and uncover the truth, Painter will ignite a war among the nation&#39;s most powerful intelligence agencies. Yet an even greater threat looms as events in the Rocky Mountains have set in motion a frightening chain reaction, a geological meltdown that threatens the entire western half of the U.S.<br /><br />From the volcanic peaks of Iceland to the blistering deserts of the American Southwest, from the gold vaults of Fort Knox to the bubbling geysers of Yellowstone, Painter Crowe joins forces with Commander Gray Pierce to penetrate the shadowy heart of a dark cabal, one that has been manipulating American history since the founding of the thirteen colonies.<br /><br />But can Painter discover the truth--one that could topple governments--before it destroys all he holds dear?

              &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, by Miguel de Cervantes, is part of the &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble Classics&quot;&quot; &quot;series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble Classics&quot;:New introductions commissioned from today&#39;s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader&#39;s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. &quot;Barnes &amp; Noble Classics &quot;pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literaryto enrich each reader&#39;s understanding of these enduring works. Widely acknowledged as the first modern novel, Miguel de Cervantes’s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; features two of the most famous characters ever created: Don Quixote, the tall, bewildered, and half-crazy knight, and Sancho Panza, his rotund and incorrigibly loyal squire. The comic and unforgettable dynamic between these two legendary figures has served as the blueprint for countless novels written since Cervantes’s time.<br /><br />An immediate success when first published in 1604, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; tells the story of a middle-aged Spanish gentleman who, obsessed with the chivalrous ideals found in romantic books, decides to take up his lance and sword to defend the helpless and destroy the wicked. Seated upon his lean nag of a horse, and accompanied by the pragmatic Sancho Panza, Don Quixote rides the roads of Spain seeking glory and grand adventure. Along the way the duo meet a dazzling assortment of characters whose diverse beliefs and perspectives reveal how reality and imagination are frequently indistinguishable.<br /><br />Profound, powerful, and hilarious, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; continues to capture the imaginations of audiences all over the world.<br /><br />Features illustrations by Gustave Doré.<br />Carole Slade specializes in late medieval and early modern European literature.Her publications include &quot;St. Teresa of Avila: Author of a Heroic Life&quot; and &quot;Approaches to Teaching Dante’s Divine Comedy”.&quot; She teaches Comparative Literature at Columbia University.

              &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author Lisa Scottoline breaks new ground and delivers the story of a soldier who discovers what it means to be a man, a father, and ultimately, a hero.<br />When Dr. Mike Scanlon is called to serve as an army doctor in Afghanistan, he&#39;s acutely aware of the dangers he&#39;ll face and the hardships it will cause his wife Chloe and newborn baby. And deep inside, he doesn&#39;t think of himself as a warrior, but a healer.<br />However, in an ironic turn of events, as Mike operates on a wounded soldier in a war-torn country, Chloe dies in their kitchen, a victim of an apparent household accident.  Devastated, Mike returns home to bury her, only to discover that the life he left behind has fallen apart.  His medical practice is in jeopardy, and he is a complete stranger to the only family he has left: his precious baby girl.  Worse, he learns a shocking secret that sends him into a downward spiral.<br />As layer upon layer of lies are revealed, Mike soon  realizes that the most important battle of his life faces him on the home front, and he&#39;ll have to put it all on the line to save what&#39;s dearest to him.  Gripping, thrilling, and profoundly emotional, Don&#39;t Go is Lisa Scottoline at her finest.

              If you&#39;ve read any of James Rollins&#39; previous books and hated it/them then I wouldn&#39;t bother picking up The Doomsday Key.  This latest adventure featuring the men &amp; women of SIGMA follows the same well worn template used for all of Rollin&#39;s previous books; namely some violent incident, this time involving the death of a priest in the vatican, leads to SIGMA uncovering a hidden conspiracy and at the same time solving some long hidden historical mystery.  Stir in some pseudo-science to give it a pretence to factual accuracy, a bunch of treasures guarded by Indiana Jones-style traps and a series of action set pieces and you end up with a piece of OTT, often ridiculous but none-the-less hugely entertaining action adventure hokum.  Nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />Assuming that you&#39;re a fan of such things and of Rollin&#39;s earlier books you&#39;ll probably find that The Doomsday Key, despite being entertaining, doesn&#39;t quite live up some of his previous efforts.  Whilst it ends with an rapid fire, tense finale, the pace of the first two thirds of the book is slightly off and at times the story seems to slow to a crawl or meander badly.  The central mystery isn&#39;t quite as compelling as it needs to be either and the main sub-plot, involving genetically modified crops, never really catches fire and then simply peters out.  There are some great set pieces, such as a blizzard bound fight in the artic reaches of Norway, but they aren&#39;t enough to entirely rescue a book that needs to be punchier but gets weighed down with too much exposition.<br /><br />Rollins also needs to move the whole &#39;Guild&#39; story arc, that has run since the first Sigma novel, forward.  I struggle to remember exactly what the Guild&#39;s primary motivation is at times.  Its all very well keeping them as an ominous, mysterious, secretive and ruthless threat in the background for a few books but if we don&#39;t begin to find out more about them, how they&#39;re organised, who their members are, etc I&#39;ll begin to lose patience.  For the threat to remain palpable they need to be more than a name and a bunch of expedendable mercenaries who get their comupance at the end of each novel.  The Doomsday Key sketches in a few new details about SIGMA&#39;s main adversaries but leaves just as many questions unanswered.<br /><br />So, if you&#39;re a Rollin&#39;s fan you&#39;ll no doubt enjoy The Doomsday Key despite its flaws.  If you&#39;re new to the author I would recommend picking up Sandstorm or one of his earlier standalone novels before tackling this latest one.  If you haven&#39;t liked any of his previous books then you&#39;re unlikely to enjoy this one either.  Personally I liked it but I also know he can do much, much better...

              Before the dozens of night stalkers slain by Buffy, there was the first and the best: Dracula. And now everyone’s favorite bloodsucker is back, and captured in a thrillingly told, spine-tingling graphic novel. Originally written by Bram Stoker in 1897, Dracula gave the world one of literature’s most compelling characters. Michael Mucci translates the tale and Ben Caldwell adds action-packed images—with meticulous attention paid to the finer details in each piece of art, from facial expressions to the historical accuracy of costuming, architecture, and heraldry. Young readers will love it.

              Here is the novel that will be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious man known as Maud&#39;dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family―and would bring to fruition humankind&#39;s most ancient and unattainable dream.<br />A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, &quot;Dune&quot; won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction. Frank Herbert&#39;s death in 1986 was a tragic loss, yet the astounding legacy of his visionary fiction will live forever.
