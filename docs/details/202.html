					<span class="cbtrans">Summary:</span> Mothers and Daughters reveals the full breadth and depth of the mother-daughter bond as only poetry can. From pregnancy to toddlerhood, adolescence to leaving home, grandmotherhood and beyond, and every passage in between, this collection captures the voices of mothers and daughters as they write about the most moving moments of their times together. Honest, inspiring, joyful, and reflective, the full range of women&#39;s voices has been captured here: the inexpressable joy of a mother holding her baby girl, a mom witnessing the first grown-up tears of her adolescent girl, a mother watching her daughter walk down the aisle, a ten-year-old trying to explain to her mom why she hates broccoli, and a daughter saying goodbye to her mother in her new dorm room. All the poetry, selected by bestselling author June Cotner, is accessible and beautifully crafted, alternating poems that will move any mother or daughter to tears with others that will make her laugh out loud--and all of which will deepen the reader&#39;s understanding and appreciation of this unique bond as no self-help book ever could. The perfect gift for a mother or daughter, this is a book that women will want to revisit and share for years to come.
