					<span class="cbtrans">Summary:</span> Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters.<br />The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.<br />Tarmon Gai&#39;don, the Last Battle, looms. And mankind is not ready.<br />The final volume of the Wheel of Time, &quot;A Memory of Light,&quot; was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan&#39;s editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books.<br />In this epic novel, Robert Jordan&#39;s international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al&#39;Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.<br />Egwene al&#39;Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.<br />The Wheel of Time®<br />&quot;New Spring: The Novel&quot;<br />#1 &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;<br />#2 &quot;The Great Hunt&quot;<br />#3 &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;<br />#4 &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;<br />#5 &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot;<br />#6 &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;<br />#7 &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;<br />#8 &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot;<br />#9 &quot;Winter&#39;s Heart&quot;<br />#10 &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;<br />#11 &quot;Knife of Dreams&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson<br />#12 &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;<br />#13 &quot;Towers of Midnight&quot;<br />#14 &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson<br />&quot;The World of Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons<br />&quot;The Wheel of Time Companion&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan and Amy Romanczuk<br />&quot;Patterns of the Wheel: &quot;&quot;Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time&quot;
