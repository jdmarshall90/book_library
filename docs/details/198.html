					<span class="cbtrans">Summary:</span> With more than 12 million books in print, rights sold in almost forty countries, and more than two years on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list (reaching as high as #1), P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast&#39;s House of Night series is an international publishing sensation. Now, for a great value, new and old fans alike can go back to where it all began, with &quot;Marked &quot;and &quot;Betrayed&quot;, together for the first time in one beautiful paperback edition.<br />When sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird is &quot;Marked&quot; by a vampyre tracker and begins to undergo the &quot;Change&quot; into an actual vampyre, she has to leave her family and move into the House of Night, a boarding school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for other fledgling vampyres like her. It&#39;s tough to begin a new life away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.  She has been singled out by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx. Although Zoey has awesome new powers, it&#39;s hard to fit in when everyone knows she&#39;s special. As she tries to make new friends and maybe find a hot boyfriend (or two), she comes up against all kinds of evil, from the perfect-looking, super-popular girl with not-so-faultless plans, to the mysterious deaths happening at the House of Night and all over Tulsa.  Things at the House of Night are not always what they seem.  Can Zoey find the courage deep within herself to discover the truth and embrace her destiny?
