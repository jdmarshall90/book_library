					<span class="cbtrans">Resumen:</span> Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters.<br />The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.<br />The final volume of the Wheel of Time, &quot;A Memory of Light,&quot; was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author of the Mistborn books, and now Stormlight Archive, among others, was chosen by Jordan&#39;s editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final volume, later expanded to three books.<br />The Last Battle has started. The seals on the Dark One&#39;s prison are crumbling. The Pattern itself is unraveling, and the armies of the Shadow have begun to boil out of the Blight.<br />The sun has begun to set upon the Third Age.<br />Perrin Aybara is now hunted by specters from his past: Whitecloaks, a slayer of wolves, and the responsibilities of leadership. All the while, an unseen foe is slowly pulling a noose tight around his neck. To prevail, he must seek answers in &quot;Tel&#39;aran&#39;rhiod&quot; and find a way--at long last--to master the wolf within him or lose himself to it forever.<br />Meanwhile, Matrim Cauthon prepares for the most difficult challenge of his life. The creatures beyond the stone gateways--the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn--have confused him, taunted him, and left him hanged, his memory stuffed with bits and pieces of other men&#39;s lives. He had hoped that his last confrontation with them would be the end of it, but the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. The time is coming when he will again have to dance with the Snakes and the Foxes, playing a game that cannot be won. The Tower of Ghenjei awaits, and its secrets will reveal the fate of a friend long lost.<br />&quot;Dovie&#39;andi se tovya sagain.&quot; It&#39;s time to toss the dice.<br />The Wheel of Time®<br />&quot;New Spring: The Novel&quot;<br />#1 &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;<br />#2 &quot;The Great Hunt&quot;<br />#3 &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;<br />#4 &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot;<br />#5 &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot;<br />#6 &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;<br />#7 &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;<br />#8 &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot;<br />#9 &quot;Winter&#39;s Heart&quot;<br />#10 &quot;Crossroads of Twilight&quot;<br />#11 &quot;Knife of Dreams&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson<br />#12 &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;<br />#13 &quot;Towers of Midnight&quot;<br />#14 &quot;A Memory of Light&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan and Teresa Patterson<br />&quot;The World of Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan, Harriet McDougal, Alan Romanczuk, and Maria Simons<br />&quot;The Wheel of Time Companion&quot;<br />By Robert Jordan and Amy Romanczuk<br />&quot;Patterns of the Wheel: &quot;&quot;Coloring Art Based on Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time&quot;
