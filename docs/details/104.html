					<span class="cbtrans">Summary:</span> I am proud to present you with a work of genius. This edition of Huckleberry Finn features superb materials and craftsmanship. The premium quality, genuine leather is dyed with a lustrous brown finish, then carefully drawn over raised spine hubs in the finest tradition of bookbinding. The elegant spine is stamped in precious 22-karat gold. The cover features a deeply impressed, beautiful illustration. Gilded page edges, polished mirror-smooth, add a distinctive touch, and they protect your investment from humidity and dust. It&#39;s safe to judge this book by its cover because the luxury and quality continue. Inside the covers are shimmering moire endleaves, dyed a deep gold. Endleaves of this quality are prized by lovers of fine books, not only for their elegant appearance and feel, but for the strength and stability they add to the binding. For your convenience, a beautiful and practical satin ribbon page marker is dyed to match. Distinguished artist Thomas Hart Benton made 87 illustrations for this edition of Huckleberry Finn, heightening the enjoyment of reading this all-time classic. For each of them he made an entire drawing in brown wash, and then covered it with a black outline. Opposite the title page is a powerful frontspiece portrait of Mark Twain, painted in watercolors by Hodges Soileau. To add depth and insight to your reading, a revealing introduction was written especially for this edition by renowned scholar historian, Pulitzer Prize winner and writer Bernard DeVoto. He also made sure that this would be the most accurate text of the novel ever published. The paper was specially milled for this edition, using acid-neutral stock of archival quality, a key element for permanence and durability, and each page has been securely sewn in place for added strength, not glued like ordinary hardcover editions. The finished result: A luxurious edition fit for Mark Twain&#39;s masterpiece. [text by David Kalvar]
