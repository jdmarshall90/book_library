					<span class="cbtrans">Resumen:</span> AN INCREDIBLE UNABRIDGED AUDIO VALUE...OVER 30 HOURS ON ONLY THREE IPOD-READY MP3 CDS!<br /><br />On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? Stephen King’s heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassination.<br /><br />Following his massively successful novel &quot;Under the Dome&quot;, King sweeps listeners back in time to another moment—a real life moment—when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces listeners to a character who has the power to change the course of history. <br /><br />Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students—a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night fifty years ago when his father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.<br /><br />Not much later, Jake’s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insane—and insanely impossible—mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jack’s life—a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time. <br /><br />A tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, &quot;11/22/63&quot; is Stephen King at his epic best.
