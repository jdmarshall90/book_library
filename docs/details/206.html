					<span class="cbtrans">Summary:</span> &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author Lisa Scottoline breaks new ground and delivers the story of a soldier who discovers what it means to be a man, a father, and ultimately, a hero.<br />When Dr. Mike Scanlon is called to serve as an army doctor in Afghanistan, he&#39;s acutely aware of the dangers he&#39;ll face and the hardships it will cause his wife Chloe and newborn baby. And deep inside, he doesn&#39;t think of himself as a warrior, but a healer.<br />However, in an ironic turn of events, as Mike operates on a wounded soldier in a war-torn country, Chloe dies in their kitchen, a victim of an apparent household accident.  Devastated, Mike returns home to bury her, only to discover that the life he left behind has fallen apart.  His medical practice is in jeopardy, and he is a complete stranger to the only family he has left: his precious baby girl.  Worse, he learns a shocking secret that sends him into a downward spiral.<br />As layer upon layer of lies are revealed, Mike soon  realizes that the most important battle of his life faces him on the home front, and he&#39;ll have to put it all on the line to save what&#39;s dearest to him.  Gripping, thrilling, and profoundly emotional, Don&#39;t Go is Lisa Scottoline at her finest.
