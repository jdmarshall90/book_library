					<span class="cbtrans">Resumen:</span> A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the  aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young  man&#39;s portrait, his subject&#39;s frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes  true. Dorian Gray&#39;s picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and  innocent. After he kills a young woman, &quot;as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a  knife&quot;, Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings.  &quot;The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my  garden.&quot; <br /> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton  encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the  delightful &quot;When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not  always happy.&quot; But despite its many languorous pleasures, &quot;The Picture of Dorian  Gray&quot; is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore,  and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel&#39;s drawing-room discussions.  Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde&#39;s supposed aims, not  least &quot;no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable  mannerism of style.&quot; Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde,  defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: &quot;All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its  own punishment.&quot;
