              From the bestselling author of the MaddAddam trilogy, here is the #1 &quot;New York Times &quot;bestseller and seminal work of speculative fiction from the Booker Prize-winning author.<br /><br />Now a Hulu series starring Elizabeth Moss, Samira Wiley, and Joseph Fiennes. Includes a new introduction by Margaret Atwood.<br /><br /> Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable.<br /><br /> Offred can remember the days before, when she lived and made love with her husband Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now….<br /><br /> Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, &quot;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&quot; is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and literary tour de force.

              Harry can&#39;t wait for his holidays with the dire Dursleys to end. But a small, self-punishing house-elf warns Harry of mortal danger awaiting him at Hogwarts School. Returning to the castle nevertheless, Harry hears a rumour about a chamber of secrets, holding unknown horrors to magicians of Muggle parentage. Now someone is casting spells that turn people to stone, and a terrible warning is found painted on the wall. The chief suspect - who&#39;s always in the wrong place - is Harry. But something much darker has yet to be unleashed.

              In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season&#39;s premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<br /><br />Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians&#39; schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders?<br /><br />But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a &quot;nice deserted moor.&quot; As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators&#39; tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes &quot;squealing the names of the players&quot; as well as &quot;tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.&quot; Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland&#39;s supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: &quot;The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field.&quot;<br /><br />Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it&#39;s true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry&#39;s life, the book&#39;s emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This Daily Prophet scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete. (Ages 9 and older) --Kerry Fried<br /><br />

              The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the Daily Prophet, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. <br /><br />And yet... <br /><br />As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate — and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.<br /><br />So it&#39;s the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here are Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort — and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.

              For my money, though I like the first two Potter books, this is where Rowling struck gold.  I started reading the series in late 1999 or early 2000, well before GOBLET came out, and when I finished the three books that at that time were out, I thought AZKABAN was not only easily the best of three, but one of the best books I had read in a long time.  The storyline is easily the strongest of the first three installments, and for once Voldemort is not the main villain driving the plot, but, so it is thought, a renegade supporter of his who murdered 13 people with a single curse.<br /><br />In AZKABAN, we learn an escaped criminal from the wizard prison Azkaban by the name of Sirius Black is out on the lam looking for Potter.  Black was once a vehement supporter for Voldemort, and now Black is gunning to finish off the job by murdering Potter, a task he had tried to do several years ago.  Not only that, Potter learns during the course of the plot that Black was James&#39; best friend, along with the new defense against the dark arts teacher, Remus Lupin. We get to learn who Scabbers really is (another instant of an character mentioned in passing on the first two novels who is hugely important here).  Black is Potter&#39;s godfather, and yet he betrayed the Potters!<br /><br />What makes Azkaban so interesting is you really get to learn about the relationships between James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew, and Severus Snape.  These five characters, and their relationships with one another, are huge portions of the foundation on which Rowling built her series.  You need a clear understanding of these characters to fully experience Rowling&#39;s series, and it is thru these characters that this book, and the series itself, is as rich as it is.  The fact no one knew that the three characters were unregistered animagus to help Remus cope with his condition was pretty cool.  <br /><br />For once, Rowling introduces a new magical artifiact called the Marauder&#39;s Map, which she uncharacteristically fully explains by the end of the novel.  It was made by Padfoot, Moony, Wormtail, and Prongs, which are the nicknames of James and his crew.  The map shows you the location of every one on the Hogwarts grounds, a tremendously useful item, supplied, appropriately enough, by those masters of mischief, Fred and George.<br /><br />Another great new bit of magic in the book is the Patronus, a magical spell that will help fight back the dementors and fear, a very advanced piece of magic for third years.  It is also very touching to know why Harry&#39;s patronus is a stag, as that is what his father transformed into.<br /><br />There are also other memorable scenes and events.  You get Hermione and the Time Turners, Buckbeak the Hippogriff,  Professor Trelawney, the Dementors, the Maurader&#39;s Map, etc.  The climax of the novel is great, but for me, it&#39;s that time when Remus, Sirus, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Snape are all in that Shreiking Shack, and you finally get to learn a lot of key information about Harry&#39;s past.  <br /><br />Ironically enough, though I have long held the opinion this is the best Potter book of them all (not including Book 7), this book has the worst movie adaptation, BECAUSE they don&#39;t fully establish all the different relationships between the four, or even explain the Marauder&#39;s Map.<br /><br />For myself, this is easily my favorite of the Potter novels, or was until DEATHLY HALLOWS came out.  Still, I have had a great history with this book, and probably reread this more than all the other Potter books.  This is the second best Potter book.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />These are my order of Potter books by preference: <br />Deathly Hallows <br />Prisoner of Azkaban <br />Order of the Phoenix <br />Philosopher&#39;s Stone/Chamber of Secrets (I rank them both the same) <br />Half-Blood Prince <br />Goblet of Fire.

              For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter&#39;s defeat of You-Know-Who was Black&#39;s downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, &quot;He&#39;s at Hogwarts . . . he&#39;s at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Harry Potter isn&#39;t safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.
