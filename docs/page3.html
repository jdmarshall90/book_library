				<p><strong>Edition:</strong> 1st Bilingual Ed</p>
				<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9780393320978</p>
				
				<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The poem Beowulf is a heroic narrative of over three-thousand lines, it concerns the deeds of a Scandinavian prince called Beowulf, who was famed for his strength and skill in combat as well as his aptitude as a great King and Lord. The poem recites and follows Beowulf&#39;s great triumphs from when he first created a name for himself in a foreign country, through his life as a king to where it closes with his own heroic death and funeral pyre.<br />Although composed in England, Beowulf is set in Scandinavia during the sixth century AD. The poem starts with the most notable warrior of the Geats, Beowulf, crossing the sea to the land of the Danes in order to rid them of a fearsome and evil monster who has terrorised King Hrothgar and his people since the construction of his impressive hall. This monster, Grendel stalked the kingdom at night attacking and devouring those who slept. After a confrontation with Grendal and then a second with the beast&#39;s mother, Beowulf returns home in triumph having killed both beasts and gaining favour from the native king. His rewards at both home and abroad are great and eventually he rises to the throne of his homeland where he rules impressively for fifty years. At this point Beowulf&#39;s final adversary emerges. A dormant dragon is woken by the theft of a gem-studded goblet from its hoard. The dragon, in a fit of rage, begins to decimate the land and it is clear that the beast must also be destroyed. A now aged Beowulf confronts the dragon in a final and decisive battle that claims both the dragon&#39;s life but also Beowulf&#39;s. In an emotive ending, Beowulf is mourned by his followers and people at his funeral, where his pyre is set alight and a memorial built. <br />Dating the poem is a very difficult task. It is understood that the poem could not have been composed before 521AD because of the reference in the poem to the death of Hygelac; the king of the Geats, who is known to have existed due to the sixth-century historian Gregory of Tours. Neither can it be later than about 1000AD as this is the date given to the only surviving Beowulf manuscript. It is uncertain when exactly between these two dates the poem was written, there are many theories on this, perhaps the most popular is for the seventh century. This is because the poet alludes to, and expects his audience to be familiar with, many characters and legends of Germanic origin that may have been forgotten in later times. Other historians have suggested the eighth century, while a few scholars have recently suggested a date as late as the tenth century. The exact date is unimportant; suffice it to say that the date of composition is thought to be some time between the seventh and tenth centuries AD. <br />Beowulf was originally written in Anglo-Saxon or Old English and there are undoubtedly many translation errors due the way in which the English language has developed. Despite this, the poem is still skilfully written and is, according to Seamus Heany &quot;one of the foundation works of poetry in English.&quot; Studying it provides many insights into the period in which it was written.<br />One of the most notable features of the text is the reverence and piety offered to the Christian God. Throughout the poem, the author shows in his writing the religious nature of the culture that he comes from. For example, from line 923, when King Hrothgar gives thanks for the destruction of Grendal he says &quot;First and foremost, let the Almighty Father be thanked for this sight.&quot; Other examples occur throughout the book, any notable event that takes place is said to have taken place through the Lord&#39;s bidding. There are also many scriptural references to the Old Testament, notably Grendal&#39;s origins that were linked to the sins committed by Caine and on more than one occasion Grendal is associated with the Devil. <br />The poem is also set in an obvious warrior culture in which a great name is to be found through great deeds on the battlefield and a good king is one who is able to defend his people and expand his borders. This type of culture is personified by the character Beowulf, hailed as the greatest hero, his fame and support stem from his prowess as a warrior and skill in battle. Presumably this type of society could be found in the period in which the poem was written, the qualities the reader sees in the hero Beowulf were the qualities that contemporaries looked for in their Lords. The &#39;code of honour&#39; exhibited in the poem is also a reflection of the chivalry that existed in the society of the author. A society whose code of honour necessitated a sense of loyalty to your King, people and allies, in which the gratitude of the Shieldings to Beowulf in ridding them of Grendal would bind them Beowulf&#39;s own people, the Geats in their time of trouble. Alliances would presumably have been forged on a basis such as this.<br />The translated poem Beowulf was a thoroughly enjoyable assignment. As well as the language and story itself being very interesting and engaging, in reading Beowulf, I found many insights into a period that I have previously never studied.</p>

				<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Victory is short-lived for the colonial forces on the world of Chalice when the Theran Union launches a devastating counterattack, employing its full power to stamp out the rebellion for good. In desperation, the new colonial government unleashes a plague, bringing widespread death and destruction to the imperial occupiers and its own citizens alike. Janice Runner is but one of many victims forced to wander a plague-infested wasteland as the two despotic regimes engage in a death struggle for control of Chalice. Her only hope of salvation lies with an idealistic rebel named Vic Shown and his allies in the resistance movement. But even they cannot save her from an alien voice growing inside her mind, promising her release if only she will allow it to draw out the monster that lies dormant inside her.</p>

				<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A fire in a Copenhagen bookstore ignites a relentless hunt across four continents. Commander Gray Pierce dives headlong into a mystery that dates back to Nazi Germany--and to horrific experiments performed in a now-abandoned laboratory buried in a hollowed-out mountain. Meanwhile, madness ravages a monastery in Nepal, as Buddhist monks turn to cannibalism and torture. Lisa Cummings, investigating the atrocity, is suddenly a target of a brutal assassin working for forces that want the affair buried. Lisa&#39;s only ally is a hidden pilgrim, Painter Crowe--director of SIGMA Force, an elite command of American scientists and Special Forces operatives--who is already showing signs of the malady that destroyed the monks. Now Pierce must save both Painter and Lisa, and a world in jeopardy--as SIGMA Force races to expose a century-old plot that threatens to destroy the current world order--and alter the destiny of humankind forever.--From publisher description.<br />     Read more...</p>

				<p><strong>Summary:</strong> n his first-ever collaboration, New York Times bestselling author James Rollins combines his skill for cutting-edge science and historical mystery with award-winning novelist Rebecca Cantrell&#39;s talent for haunting suspense and sensual atmosphere in a gothic tale about an ancient order and the hunt for a miraculous book known only as . . . The Blood Gospel<br /><br />An earthquake in Masada, Israel, kills hundreds and reveals a tomb buried in the heart of the mountain. A trio of investigators—Sergeant Jordan Stone, a military forensic expert; Father Rhun Korza, a Vatican priest; and Dr. Erin Granger, a brilliant but disillusioned archaeologist—are sent to explore the macabre discovery, a subterranean temple holding the crucified body of a mummified girl.<br /><br />But a brutal attack at the site sets the three on the run, thrusting them into a race to recover what was once preserved in the tomb&#39;s sarcophagus: a book rumored to have been written by Christ&#39;s own hand, a tome that is said to hold the secrets to His divinity. The enemy who hounds them is like no other, a force of ancient evil directed by a leader of impossible ambitions and incalculable cunning.<br /><br />From crumbling tombs to splendorous churches, Erin and her two companions must confront a past that traces back thousands of years, to a time when ungodly beasts hunted the dark spaces of the world, to a moment in history when Christ made a miraculous offer, a pact of salvation for those who were damned for eternity.<br /><br />Here is a novel that is explosive in its revelation of a secret history. Why do Catholic priests wear pectoral crosses? Why are they sworn to celibacy? Why do the monks hide their countenances under hoods? And why does Catholicism insist that the consecration of wine during Mass results in its transformation to Christ&#39;s own blood? The answers to all go back to a secret sect within the Vatican, one whispered as rumor but whose very existence was painted for all to see by Rembrandt himself, a shadowy order known simply as the Sanguines.<br /><br />In the end, be warned: some books should never be found, never opened—until now.</p>

				<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In a thrilling masterwork that will make you rethink your perceptions of life and death, New York Times bestselling author James Rollins takes you to the edge of medicine, genetics, and technology, revealing the next evolutionary leap forward: immortality.<br /><br /><br />Galilee, 1025. Infiltrating an ancient citadel, a Templar knight uncovers a holy treasure long hidden within the fortress&#39;s labyrinth: the Bachal Isu -- the staff of Jesus Christ -- a priceless icon that holds a mysterious and terrifying power that promises to change humankind forever.Â <br /><br /><br />A millennium later, Somali pirates hijack a yacht off the coast of the Horn of Africa, kidnapping a young pregnant American woman. Commander Gray Pierce is enlisted for a covert rescue mission into the African jungle. The woman is no rich tourist: she&#39;s Amanda Gant-Bennett, daughter of the U.S. president.Â <br /><br /><br />Suspicious that the kidnapping masks a far more nefarious plot, Gray must confront a shadowy cabal which has been manipulating events throughout history...and now challenges the current presidency. Â <br /><br /><br />For this unique mission, SIGMA is aided by a pair of special operatives with unique talents: former Army Ranger Captain Tucker Wayne and his military war dog, Kane. But what should be a straightforward rescue turns into a fiery ambush and a deadly act of betrayal, as Gray and his team discover that the hostage is a pawn in a shattering act of terrorism with dark repercussions. And the danger is only beginning...Â <br /><br /><br />Halfway around the world, a firebombing at a fertility clinic in South Carolina exposes a conspiracy that goes back centuries...a scheme that lies within our genetic code. With time against them, SIGMA must race to save an innocent unborn baby whose very existence raises questions about the nature of humanity, asking:Â <br /><br /><br />Could you live forever?Â <br /><br /><br />Would you live forever?<br /></p>

				<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In the remote mountains of Croatia, an archaeologist makes a strange discovery: a subterranean Catholic chapel, hidden for centuries, holds the bones of a Neanderthal woman. In the same cavern system, elaborate primitive paintings tell the story of an immense battle between tribes of Neanderthals and monstrous shadowy figures. Who is this mysterious enemy depicted in these ancient drawings, and what do the paintings mean? Before any questions can be answered, the investigative team is attacked, while at the same time, a bloody assault is made upon a primate research center outside of Atlanta. How are these events connected? Who is behind these attacks? The search for the truth will take Commander Gray Pierce of Sigma Force 50,000 years into the past.&quot;--<br />     Read more...</p>
